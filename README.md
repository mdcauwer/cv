# Milan De Cauwer

I currently am a postdoctoral researcher at the School of Computer Science and Information Technology,  University College Cork, Ireland. I am a computer scientist with a background in  operations research, combinatorial optimisation and currently curious about applied machine learning and data sciences.

I find great motivation in bringing together technologies from the realm of artificial intelligence to tackle automated decision-making problems in sustainability related challenges.

## Professional experience

### Postdoctoral Researcher, University College Cork (2019-now)

Research tasks: 
* Investigating the integration of signal processing, machine learning and optimisation techniques to enhance predictive maintenance.
* Technologies: Python, Jupyter, Pandas, Numpy, Scikit-learn.

### PhD Candidate, University College Cork (2012-18)
* Combinatorial Optimisation for Sustainable Cloud Computing ([Manuscript][thesis])
* Supervisors: [Prof Barry O'Sullivan][bos], [Dr Deepak Metha][dm]
* Funding: [Science Foundation Ireland][SFI]
* Short abstract:

> The era of data-driven decision-making often relies on data centres as a backbone to store, structure and retrieve information for use in cloud computing contexts. Because these ubiquitous facilities have a large economic and ecological footprint, designing methods to exploit them efficiently is a central challenge in maintaining such structures sustainable. My dissertation contributes to the effort of formally modeling parts of such systems for optimisation purposes. More specifically, the focus is put on modeling and optimising consolidation problems techniques from the realm of mathematical modeling and operations research.
